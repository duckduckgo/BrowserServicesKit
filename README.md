## What is it?

`BrowserServicesKit` is a package that contains modules shared between DuckDuckGo projects.

## Building

The package uses submodules, which will need to be cloned in order for the project to build:

Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

`BrowserServicesKit` can be built manually two ways:

1. Build the `BrowserServicesKit` scheme by opening the Swift package in Xcode
2. Run `swift build -c release` to build a release binary

## Testing

Run `swift test` on the project root folder. Please note that running the tests on Xcode will not work.

## Additional configuration

In projects utilizing the Swift Package Manager, it may not be possible to specify a custom file name when creating new Swift files within Xcode, resulting in the generation of placeholder names (i.e. "File.swift"). To resolve this issue: 

Run `scripts/setup-new-file-template.sh`

It will add a template named "Swift File For Package" to your Xcode templates, allowing for the specification of a custom file name when creating new Swift files.

### SwiftLint

We use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for enforcing Swift style and conventions, so you'll need to [install it](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#installation).
