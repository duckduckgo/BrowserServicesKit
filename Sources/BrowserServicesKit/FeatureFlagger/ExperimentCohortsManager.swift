    /// one of the experiment's defined cohorts), the method returns the assigned cohort.
    /// Otherwise, the invalid cohort is removed, and a new cohort is assigned if
    /// `isAssignCohortEnabled` is `true`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - experiment: The `ExperimentSubfeature` representing the experiment and its associated cohorts.
    ///   - isAssignCohortEnabled: A Boolean value indicating whether cohort assignment is allowed
    ///     if the user is not already assigned to a valid cohort.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The valid `CohortID` assigned to the user for the experiment, or `nil`
    ///   if no valid cohort exists and `isAssignCohortEnabled` is `false`.
    ///
    /// - Behavior:
    ///   1. Retrieves the currently assigned cohort for the experiment using the `subfeatureID`.
    ///   2. Validates if the assigned cohort exists within the experiment's cohort list:
    ///      - If valid, the assigned cohort is returned.
    ///      - If invalid, the cohort is removed from storage.
    ///   3. If cohort assignment is enabled (`isAssignCohortEnabled` is `true`), a new cohort
    ///      is assigned based on the experiment's cohort weights and saved in storage.
    ///      - Cohort assignment is probabilistic, determined by the cohort weights.
